# Soul Feeler
Welcome to an open-source song, one of the first of its kind!

As I started to compose this song, I realized there were multiple avenues I could take it. I created a very small
portion of this idea, albeit a not so good one, and have the mp3 version of this song.

The mp3 version of the song isn't necessarily synced with the DAW version. *Soul Feeler mock.band* is mainly just some recorded pieces. 

You are welcome to use what I have worked on and build your own piece based off it. Submit a pull request or email it to
me because I'm curious about different variations.
